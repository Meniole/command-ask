Show plugin readme on installing a new plugin (original comment)\n3. Show indicator if plugin is already installed (original comment)\n4. Load current config values in the editor (if config is present)\n5. Add \"Reset to defaults\" button which resets plugin options to default values (original comment)\n6.

      "expectedResponse": "Based on the issue discussion and linked issues, here's a summary of the UI improvements needed:\n\n1. Configuration Simplification:\n- Remove the \"select configuration\" step\n- Always use \"production\" config as this is for partners\n- Development configs can be created manually when needed\n\n2. Plugin Information Display:\n- Show plugin readme when installing new plugins\n- Add indicator to show if a plugin is already installed\n- Load and display current config values in the editor when available\n\n3. Configuration Management:\n- Add \"Reset to defaults\" button for plugin options\n- Ensure proper handling of config values\n\n4. GitHub Integration:\n- Add GitHub redirect functionality to the same page\n- Reference implementation available in work.ubq.fi repository\n\nThis implementation depends on the config installer feature (#13) being completed first. The changes focus on improving user experience for partners while maintaining development flexibility through manual configuration options.",
